BESPOKE CLOTHING — Immediate Demo ZIP

This ZIP contains a ready-to-run Next.js demo for presentation. To run locally:
1. Install Node.js (v16+).
2. Unzip and open a terminal in the folder.
3. Run:
   npm install
   npm run dev
4. Open http://localhost:3000 and click 'Design your own look in 3D'.

Notes:
- 3D models load if you place GLB files in /public/models and set product.model paths.
- The demo uses placeholder images and localStorage for saves/cart.
- If you want, I can deploy this to Vercel for a live URL after your presentation.
